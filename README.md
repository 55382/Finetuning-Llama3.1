This project  involves fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 model using Unsloth, a tool that accelerates fine-tuning. it focuses on conversational fine-tuning using the FineTome-100k dataset in ShareGPT format. Here's a breakdown of the work and the key features:

### Key Highlights:
1. **Unsloth Setup**:
   - You used **Unsloth** for faster fine-tuning, enabling you to achieve up to 2x faster results. Unsloth also supports various models, including Llama, Mistral, Phi, and others.
   - You fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 model with **4-bit quantization** (which helps with memory efficiency and speed).

2. **Model and Dataset**:
   - You utilized the **FineTome-100k dataset** (converted from ShareGPT format to HuggingFace's generic multiturn format), which consists of conversations. These datasets are preprocessed to be compatible with the model and task at hand.
   - You used the `standardize_sharegpt` function to convert the dataset to HuggingFace's format.

3. **Training Setup**:
   - You set up **LoRA adapters** to only update a small percentage of the parameters (e.g., 1-10%) for more efficient training.
   - The training involved **gradient accumulation** and **gradient checkpointing** to optimize memory usage.

4. **Training Procedure**:
   - You employed the **SFTTrainer** from HuggingFace's **TRL** library for supervised fine-tuning.
   - Only the assistant responses (ignoring the user's input) were used for training via `train_on_responses_only`, which optimizes the model for conversational tasks.

5. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - By leveraging techniques like **4-bit quantization** and **LoRA**, you significantly reduced memory usage, allowing you to train larger models on GPUs with limited memory.
   - The **gradient accumulation steps** helped ensure that you could process larger batches without running into memory issues.

6. **Inference**:
   - You performed inference on the fine-tuned model by providing conversational prompts like the Fibonacci sequence continuation.
   - The **temperature** and **min_p** values were adjusted for diverse generation outputs, and you used continuous inference with a **TextStreamer** to see the model's predictions in real-time.

### Example of Model Usage:
```python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Continue the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,"},
]

# Prepare input with the appropriate chat template
inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages, tokenize=True, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt"
).to("cuda")

# Generate response
outputs = model.generate(input_ids=inputs, max_new_tokens=64, use_cache=True, temperature=1.5, min_p=0.1)

# Decode and print the response
print(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs))
```

### Results:
For the Fibonacci sequence prompt, the model generated the continuation:
```
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence is: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.
```

### Next Steps:
- **Evaluation**: we may want to assess the fine-tuned model's performance using metrics like perplexity or conversational quality, possibly with a separate validation dataset.
- **Optimization**:we could experiment with other configurations of **LoRA** or adjust hyperparameters to further fine-tune the performance.
- **Deployment**: we can deploy it for real-time applications, such as customer support chatbots or educational tools.
