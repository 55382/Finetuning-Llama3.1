We support Llama, Mistral, Phi-3, Gemma, Yi, DeepSeek, Qwen, TinyLlama, Vicuna, Open Hermes etc
We support 16bit LoRA or 4bit QLoRA. Both 2x faster.
max_seq_length can be set to anything, since we do automatic RoPE Scaling via kaiokendev's method.

from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

max_seq_length = 2048 # Choose any! We auto support RoPE Scaling internally!
dtype = None # None for auto detection. Float16 for Tesla T4, V100, Bfloat16 for Ampere+
load_in_4bit = True # Use 4bit quantization to reduce memory usage. Can be False.

# 4bit pre quantized models we support for 4x faster downloading + no OOMs.

# This is formatted as code
We now add LoRA adapters so we only need to update 1 to 10% of all parameters!

Unsloth 2024.10.3 patched 28 layers with 28 QKV layers, 28 O layers and 28 MLP layers.

Data Prep
We now use the Llama-3.1 format for conversation style finetunes. We use Maxime Labonne's FineTome-100k dataset in ShareGPT style. But we convert it to HuggingFace's normal multiturn format ("role", "content") instead of ("from", "value")/ Llama-3 renders multi turn conversations like below:

<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Hello!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Hey there! How are you?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm great thanks!<|eot_id|>
We use our get_chat_template function to get the correct chat template. We support zephyr, chatml, mistral, llama, alpaca, vicuna, vicuna_old, phi3, llama3 and more.


from unsloth.chat_templates import get_chat_template

tokenizer = get_chat_template(
    tokenizer,
    chat_template = "llama-3.1",
)

def formatting_prompts_func(examples):
    convos = examples["conversations"]
    texts = [tokenizer.apply_chat_template(convo, tokenize = False, add_generation_prompt = False) for convo in convos]
    return { "text" : texts, }
pass

from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("mlabonne/FineTome-100k", split = "train")

We now use standardize_sharegpt to convert ShareGPT style datasets into HuggingFace's generic format. This changes the dataset from looking like:

{"from": "system", "value": "You are an assistant"}
{"from": "human", "value": "What is 2+2?"}
{"from": "gpt", "value": "It's 4."}
to

{"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant"}
{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "It's 4."}

from unsloth.chat_templates import standardize_sharegpt
dataset = standardize_sharegpt(dataset)
dataset = dataset.map(formatting_prompts_func, batched = True,)
     
Standardizing format:   0%|          | 0/100000 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]
Map:   0%|          | 0/100000 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]
We look at how the conversations are structured for item 5:


dataset[5]["conversations"]
     
[{'content': 'How do astronomers determine the original wavelength of light emitted by a celestial body at rest, which is necessary for measuring its speed using the Doppler effect?',
  'role': 'user'},
 {'content': 'Astronomers make use of the unique spectral fingerprints of elements found in stars. These elements emit and absorb light at specific, known wavelengths, forming an absorption spectrum. By analyzing the light received from distant stars and comparing it to the laboratory-measured spectra of these elements, astronomers can identify the shifts in these wavelengths due to the Doppler effect. The observed shift tells them the extent to which the light has been redshifted or blueshifted, thereby allowing them to calculate the speed of the star along the line of sight relative to Earth.',
  'role': 'assistant'}]
And we see how the chat template transformed these conversations.

[Notice] Llama 3.1 Instruct's default chat template default adds "Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024", so do not be alarmed!


dataset[5]["text"]

Train the model
Now let's use Huggingface TRL's SFTTrainer! More docs here: TRL SFT docs. We do 60 steps to speed things up, but you can set num_train_epochs=1 for a full run, and turn off max_steps=None. We also support TRL's DPOTrainer!


from trl import SFTTrainer
from transformers import TrainingArguments, DataCollatorForSeq2Seq
from unsloth import is_bfloat16_supported

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model = model,
    tokenizer = tokenizer,
    train_dataset = dataset,
    dataset_text_field = "text",
    max_seq_length = max_seq_length,
    data_collator = DataCollatorForSeq2Seq(tokenizer = tokenizer),
    dataset_num_proc = 2,
    packing = False, # Can make training 5x faster for short sequences.
    args = TrainingArguments(
        per_device_train_batch_size = 2,
        gradient_accumulation_steps = 4,
        warmup_steps = 5,
        # num_train_epochs = 1, # Set this for 1 full training run.
        max_steps = 60,
        learning_rate = 2e-4,
        fp16 = not is_bfloat16_supported(),
        bf16 = is_bfloat16_supported(),
        logging_steps = 1,
        optim = "adamw_8bit",
        weight_decay = 0.01,
        lr_scheduler_type = "linear",
        seed = 3407,
        output_dir = "outputs",
        report_to = "none", # Use this for WandB etc
    ),
)
     
Map (num_proc=2):   0%|          | 0/100000 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]
max_steps is given, it will override any value given in num_train_epochs
We also use Unsloth's train_on_completions method to only train on the assistant outputs and ignore the loss on the user's inputs.


from unsloth.chat_templates import train_on_responses_only
trainer = train_on_responses_only(
    trainer,
    instruction_part = "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    response_part = "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
)
     
Map:   0%|          | 0/100000 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]
We verify masking is actually done:


tokenizer.decode(trainer.train_dataset[5]["input_ids"])
     
'<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nHow do astronomers determine the original wavelength of light emitted by a celestial body at rest, which is necessary for measuring its speed using the Doppler effect?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAstronomers make use of the unique spectral fingerprints of elements found in stars.

space = tokenizer(" ", add_special_tokens = False).input_ids[0]
tokenizer.decode([space if x == -100 else x for x in trainer.train_dataset[5]["labels"]])
     
'                                                                \n\nAstronomers make use of the unique spectral fingerprints of elements found in stars.

We can see the System and Instruction prompts are successfully masked!

Inference
Let's run the model! You can change the instruction and input - leave the output blank!

We use min_p = 0.1 and temperature = 1.5. Read this Tweet for more information on why.


from unsloth.chat_templates import get_chat_template

tokenizer = get_chat_template(
    tokenizer,
    chat_template = "llama-3.1",
)
FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model) # Enable native 2x faster inference

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Continue the fibonnaci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,"},
]
inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize = True,
    add_generation_prompt = True, # Must add for generation
    return_tensors = "pt",
).to("cuda")

outputs = model.generate(input_ids = inputs, max_new_tokens = 64, use_cache = True,
                         temperature = 1.5, min_p = 0.1)
tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)
     
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
['<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nContinue the fibonnaci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence is: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.<|eot_id|>']
You can also use a TextStreamer for continuous inference - so you can see the generation token by token, instead of waiting the whole time!


FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model) # Enable native 2x faster inference

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Continue the fibonnaci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,"},

    messages,
    tokenize = True,
    add_generation_prompt = True, # Must add for generation
    return_tensors = "pt",
).to("cuda")

from transformers import TextStreamer
text_streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer, skip_prompt = True)
_ = model.generate(input_ids = inputs, streamer = text_streamer, max_new_tokens = 128,
                   use_cache = True, temperature = 1.5, min_p = 0.1)
     
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. 

The sequence you provided was: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

The next number in the sequence would be 21, which is 8 + 13. The sequence continues as: 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233.<|eot_id|>

Saving, loading finetuned models
To save the final model as LoRA adapters, either use Huggingface's push_to_hub for an online save or save_pretrained for a local save.

[NOTE] This ONLY saves the LoRA adapters, and not the full model. To save to 16bit or GGUF, scroll down!


model.save_pretrained("lora_model") # Local saving
tokenizer.save_pretrained("lora_model")
# model.push_to_hub("your_name/lora_model", token = "...") # Online saving
# tokenizer.push_to_hub("your_name/lora_model", token = "...") # Online saving
     
('lora_model/tokenizer_config.json',
 'lora_model/special_tokens_map.json',
 'lora_model/tokenizer.json')
Now if you want to load the LoRA adapters we just saved for inference, set False to True:


if False:
    from unsloth import FastLanguageModel
    model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
        model_name = "lora_model", # YOUR MODEL YOU USED FOR TRAINING
        max_seq_length = max_seq_length,
        dtype = dtype,
        load_in_4bit = load_in_4bit,
    )
    FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model) # Enable native 2x faster inference

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Describe a tall tower in the capital of France."},
]
inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize = True,
    add_generation_prompt = True, # Must add for generation
    return_tensors = "pt",
).to("cuda")

from transformers import TextStreamer
text_streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer, skip_prompt = True)
_ = model.generate(input_ids = inputs, streamer = text_streamer, max_new_tokens = 128,
                   use_cache = True, temperature = 1.5, min_p = 0.1)
     
The Eiffel Tower, located in the heart of Paris, stands tall among the city's historic and cultural landmarks. This iron structure, standing at an impressive 324 meters high, offers breathtaking views of the City of Light's iconic landscape. The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 World's Fair and has since become a symbol of French engineering and culture.<|eot_id|>
You can also use Hugging Face's AutoModelForPeftCausalLM. Only use this if you do not have unsloth installed. It can be hopelessly slow, since 4bit model downloading is not supported, and Unsloth's inference is 2x faster.


if False:
    # I highly do NOT suggest - use Unsloth if possible
    from peft import AutoPeftModelForCausalLM
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer
    model = AutoPeftModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
        "lora_model", # YOUR MODEL YOU USED FOR TRAINING
        load_in_4bit = load_in_4bit,
    )
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("lora_model")
     
Saving to float16 for VLLM
We also support saving to float16 directly. Select merged_16bit for float16 or merged_4bit for int4. We also allow lora adapters as a fallback. Use push_to_hub_merged to upload to your Hugging Face account! You can go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens for your personal tokens.

GGUF / llama.cpp Conversion
To save to GGUF / llama.cpp, we support it natively now! We clone llama.cpp and we default save it to q8_0. We allow all methods like q4_k_m. Use save_pretrained_gguf for local saving and push_to_hub_gguf for uploading to HF.

Some supported quant methods (full list on our Wiki page):

q8_0 - Fast conversion. High resource use, but generally acceptable.
q4_k_m - Recommended. Uses Q6_K for half of the attention.wv and feed_forward.w2 tensors, else Q4_K.
q5_k_m - Recommended. Uses Q6_K for half of the attention.wv and feed_forward.w2 tensors, else Q5_K.
[NEW] To finetune and auto export to Ollama, try our Ollama notebook


# Save to 8bit Q8_0
if False: model.save_pretrained_gguf("model", tokenizer,)
# Remember to go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens for a token!
# And change hf to your username!
if False: model.push_to_hub_gguf("hf/model", tokenizer, token = "")

# Save to 16bit GGUF
if False: model.save_pretrained_gguf("model", tokenizer, quantization_method = "f16")
if False: model.push_to_hub_gguf("hf/model", tokenizer, quantization_method = "f16", token = "")

# Save to q4_k_m GGUF
if False: model.save_pretrained_gguf("model", tokenizer, quantization_method = "q4_k_m")
if False: model.push_to_hub_gguf("hf/model", tokenizer, quantization_method = "q4_k_m", token = "")

# Save to multiple GGUF options - much faster if you want multiple!
if False:
    model.push_to_hub_gguf(
        "hf/model", # Change hf to your username!
        tokenizer,
        quantization_method = ["q4_k_m", "q8_0", "q5_k_m",],
        token = "", # Get a token at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
    )
     
Now, use the model-unsloth.gguf file or model-unsloth-Q4_K_M.gguf file in llama.cpp or a UI based system like GPT4All. You can install GPT4All by going here.
